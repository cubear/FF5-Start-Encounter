# FF5-Start-Encounter
A mod for FF5 (SNES) to force encounters while walking with Start held down.


Start_Encounter leaves the encounter rate as per normal, with encounters forced by holding start while walking.

Only_Start_Encounter disables normal random battles, and you MUST be holding start in order to start a random encounter.

To be applied on a 4MB (32mbit) expanded, headerless Final Fantasy 5 rom.
